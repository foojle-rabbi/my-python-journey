# üìù Practice Problems: Lists & Tuples

### 1. Create a list of 5 integers, then print:
- The first element
- The last element
- The length of the list

---

### 2. Given a list of numbers, write a program to:
- Add a new number to the end of the list
- Remove the second element
- Print the updated list

---

### 3. Write a program to:
- Take a tuple of 4 elements (any data type)
- Print each element in a separate line using a loop

---

### 4. Given a list of names, write a program to:
- Check if a given name is in the list (print True/False)
- Count how many times a particular name appears

---

### 5. Write a program that:
- Creates a list of 3 tuples, each tuple having 2 integers
- Prints the sum of the two integers in each tuple  

Example:  
`[(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]` ‚Üí output: 3, 7, 11

---
