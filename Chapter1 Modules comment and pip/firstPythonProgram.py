print("Hello world")

""""
Today is 24th may 2025; I have started my python learning journey. The main reson of starting learning
this language to make some real world project. As we know that making real world project gives us a lot
of experience of making a idea into reality. NOt only that it also help us to build, execute, code, debug
and many more.


So I wish I could make something that will help others. I want to build something different. I want make something
exeptional. Oh my God please give me "taufiq" so that i could do something best. Insha-Allah allah is with me <3;
